# FSE 2017 Robot

This package showcases how to work with the robot developed in the course of
Full Stack Embedded's 2017 courses taking place in Accra, Ghana and Lome, Togo.
Use these lines as inspiration for your own code or use it directly, e.g. as
follows:

    import time
    from fse_2017_robot import Robot
    with Robot() as r:
        r.led.on()
        r.set_drive_mode(1)
        while not r.obstacle < 50:
            r.led.toggle()
            time.sleep(0.25)

This drives the robot forward with its LED blinking on and off until an obstacle
is detected less than 50 cm away.
